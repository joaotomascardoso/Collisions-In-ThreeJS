# Collisions-In-ThreeJS

College project to exemplify movement around a sphere, collisions between objects and different cameras.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Every time you refresh the page both the rocket and the asteroids spawn randomly in a plane at a set distance around the center sphere(the earth).

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the rocket into colliding with the asteroids to make them explode(disappear).

You can switch between cameras using the keys "1" "2" and "3" in your keyboard.

Have fun!!
